DIET-SALVE                                      *diet-salve*

Tim Pope's original vim-salve plugin provided static Vim support for Leiningen
and Boot.

vim-diet-salve is a trimmed-down version of vim-salve with some features
removed, as a trade-off to allow the benefits of the remaining features to be
had without having to endure the cost of long Vim startup time that occurs as
a result of the classpath detection that vim-salve does.

What follows is straight out of `:help salve`, with the only changes being
deletions of features that vim-diet-salve does not support.

INTRODUCTION                                    *salve*

Salve.vim automatically activates when it finds a project.clj
or build.boot in a parent directory of the current file. 

If `g:salve_auto_start_repl` is set, salve.vim will attempt to make a REPL
connection for you.

REPL SUPPORT                                    *salve-repl*

Each time |fireplace| attempts to use a repl connection, salve.vim will
try to automatically connect using target/repl-port or target/repl/repl-port.
(Fireplace itself supports the newer standard .nrepl-port.)  If none of the 3
port files exist, :Console! (see below) is invoked to automatically start a
repl.

                                                *salve-:Console*
:Console                Invoke `lein repl` or `boot repl` using |:dispatch-:Start|.

:Console!               Like :Console, but start in the background.

If a suitably fresh repl is running when an updated classpath is required, it
will be used instead of shelling out to determine the classpath.

COMPILER                                        *salve-compiler*

The included lein and boot compiler plugins are automatically invoked
for Leiningen or Boot projects so that |:make| (or |dispatch-:Make|)
will invoke `lein` or `boot`.
